            <p>Month 0 is the first month of the curriculum here at Code School. It is here to let you prepare for what is to come. It also gets you to a point where you understand the basic fundamentals of computer science, computers, and the internet.</p>
            <p>The general plan of Month 0 is to install a text editor on your computer that will help you write code, install related technologies such as Git, and take an introduction to computer science course working on fundamentals.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Take this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="blank">quick course</a> on How to Learn.</li>
